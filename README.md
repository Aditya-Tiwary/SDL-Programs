# SDL Programs

This repository contains various C programs that utilize the Simple DirectMedia Layer (SDL) library to create graphical applications. Each program is implemented in a separate folder, and the source file for each program is named `practical.c`.

## Requirements

Before running any of the programs, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed on your system:

1. Visual Studio with C/C++ support.
2. SDL Library (SDL2)

For program 4, you will also need the `arial.ttf` font file.

## Instructions for Visual Studio

To compile and run any program using Visual Studio, follow these steps:

1. Ensure that you have met the requirements mentioned above.
2. Clone this repository to your local machine or download the ZIP archive.
3. Open Visual Studio and create a new C/C++ project.
4. Add the `practical.c` file from the desired program's folder to the project.
5. Include the SDL library in your project. You can do this by adding the necessary SDL header files and linking to the SDL library.
6. Build the project to generate the executable.
7. Run the compiled executable from Visual Studio.
